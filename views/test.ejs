            <h3>How it works</h3>
            <p>A mental health test is an evaluation tool that assesses an individual's psychological well-being. It typically involves questions and exercises designed to gauge mood, stress, coping strategies, and overall mental resilience. The results guide mental health professionals in identifying issues and tailoring support and treatment, with a focus on patient comfort and confidentiality.</p>
